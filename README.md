## Hi there! I'm Carsten ðŸ‘‹

### My passion belongs to the world of mathematics. 

I am working as a **consultant data science** with a focus on **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning at scale**. In doing so, I oversee the entire chain of value creation which includes the conception and translation of relevant issues, modeling, implementation as well as the back translation and technical connection. With the proper linkage, insights gained via artificial intelligence become a competitive advantage.  

### I have worked on projects in the subject of
* data mining and analysis on unbalanced panels
* recommender systems
* pricing
* forecasting
* risk management

### Whats going on?
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on recommender systems and exploitation steps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MLOps.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on analytics in sports.

### Get in touch.
